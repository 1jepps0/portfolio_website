        <p>
            A <b>Cybersecurity student</b> who thrives on understanding how things work.
        </p>

              <p>
             At the University of South Carolina Aiken, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, concentrating in Cybersecurity. While attending,
             I’ve been an active member of the university's Capture the Flag (CTF) team, where I’ve tackled a wide range of cybersecurity challenges.
             You can find my write-ups for these challenges <a class="p-link" href="{% url "writeups" %}">here</a>.
             Notably, I've helped secure our team 3rd place in Carolina Con 2024. Through my experience in cybersecurity and CTF competitions, 
             I’ve developed a deep interest in reverse engineering, binary analysis, and penetration testing. These avenues allow me to leverage my understanding of low-level
             programming languages to manipulate a program into unexpected behaviour.
 
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond competitions, I’ve also developed coding <a class="p-link" href="{% url "projects" %}">projects</a> that are both practical and personally meaningful,
            focusing on solutions that improve my workflow or address real-world problems.
        </p>
